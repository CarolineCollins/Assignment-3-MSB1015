# Assignment-3-MSB1015
### Synopsis
A project to learn how to use Nextflow, SPARQL query, and CDK to calculate JPlogP on all the molecules in WikiData.
Here on the README note the results of a comparison of computation times on different numbers of threads.

### Thought for the day:
`"Mistakes can and will happen, but by encouraging researchers to be open about them 
and not reprimanding others for them, open science can counter incentives to hide mistakes." `
